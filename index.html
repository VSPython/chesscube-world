            <h2>Welcome.</h2>
            <p class="about-me-row">Bonjour, I am ChessCube, a python coder, speedcuber, chess player, and many more.
                If you asked a friend about me, they would probably tell you that I have a lot of odd talents,
                some that many people don't do. These include, solving the rubik's cube,
                being able to continually shoot backward freethrows and other
                trickshots at a high gameplay and many more. I also like to help others, and be creative with ideas.
                In addition to all of this, I am an owner or admin of many clubs and project creations.
                You can scroll to contacts section to join some of my communities and have fun :)   </p>

              <h3>Speed Cubing</h3>
              <p>SpeedCubing is one of my biggest hobbies. I have been cubing for 9-10 years, starting out when I was 4.
                  I currently average ~16 seconds consistently on 3x3,
                  and have a wide variety of other events I like to do as well.</p>

              <h3>Programming [Python]</h3>
              <p>I like creating python projects and designing a layout for them.
                  Most projects are based on my hobbies like cubing or chess.
                  Currently, I'm still learning a lot, and hoping to become a very good developer in the future.</p>
